🚀 Starting Hooks Functionality Test

🔔 IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. Hooks are configured in .claude/settings.local.json
2. You should hear a completion sound after each response (Stop hook)
3. Check /tmp/claude-hook-test.log for hook execution logs
4. Hook execution happens outside this test process

📋 Current Hook Configuration:
[
  {
    "event": "Stop",
    "command": "ffplay -nodisp -autoexit /home/hassan/anthropic-sdk/done.mp3",
    "timeout": 5000,
    "description": "Play completion sound when Claude finishes responding"
  }
]
