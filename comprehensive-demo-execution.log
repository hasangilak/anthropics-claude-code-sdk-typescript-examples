🚀 Claude Code SDK - Complete Feature Demo
==================================================
This demo will showcase:
✅ TypeScript SDK Integration
✅ Real-time Streaming JSON Communication
✅ Interactive Permission System
✅ Multiple Tool Usage
✅ Hooks Integration (completion sound)
✅ File Operations
✅ Error Handling
==================================================

📤 Demo Prompt:
Please demonstrate multiple Claude Code capabilities:

1. Create a demo directory called "sdk-demo"
2. Create a JSON file with some sample data
3. List the current directory contents
4. Search for any files containing "demo" 
5. Create a summary file with what you accomplished

This will test Write, Bash, LS, Grep, and multiple tool coordination with permission system.
