✅ Interactive Permission System
✅ Multiple Tool Usage
✅ Hooks Integration (completion sound)
✅ File Operations
✅ Error Handling
==================================================

📤 Demo Prompt:
Please demonstrate multiple Claude Code capabilities:

1. Create a demo directory called "sdk-demo"
2. Create a JSON file with some sample data
3. List the current directory contents
4. Search for any files containing "demo"
